{$define "#subject" }Kickstarter "You Don't Know JS": Reward Info Survey ({$insert $.name $}){$}


{$define "#body" }
{$insert $.name $},

Thank you so much for being a backer last summer of my Kickstarter project for the "You Don't Know JS" book series.

I know I'm well behind on the schedule for delivery of the books and the rewards, but I assure you I'm working hard to get all of them finished and fulfilled ASAP. I apologize for the long delays.

To that end, I have built a simple survey site to collect information from you necessary to ensure proper fulfillment of all rewards. Please make sure to save this link, as it includes your unique account ID, and is necessary for you to access and update your information.

http://kickstarter.youdontknowjs.com/#{$insert $.user_id $}

Click the link (or copy-n-paste if clicking doesn't work in your email client), and enter the email you've received this notice at: {$insert $.email $}

Once logged in, double-check that the information in the system already is correct, and make any changes or additions as necessary. You can re-visit the link above to update your information (for instance, if you change your email or move) as many times as necessary.

Thanks again,
Kyle Simpson (getify)
